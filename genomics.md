#####DNA
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the chemical compound that contains the instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living organisms.

An organism's complete set of DNA is called its genome.
DNA contains the information needed to build the entire human body. 
A gene traditionally refers to the unit of DNA that carries the instructions for making a specific protein or set of proteins.

#####DNA Sequencing  
Sequencing simply means determining the exact order of the bases in a strand of DNA.
Need to assemble the sequence of all the bases in a large piece of DNA. It's like putting together a linear jigsaw puzzle!

Application:
Researchers can use DNA sequencing to search for genetic variations and/or mutations that may play a role in the development or progression of a disease. The disease-causing change may be as small as the substitution, deletion, or addition of a single base pair or as large as a deletion of thousands of bases.

#####Genomics
Genomics is an area within genetics that concerns the sequencing and analysis of an organism’s genome.

Genomics is a discipline in genetics that applies recombinant DNA, DNA sequencing methods, and bioinformatics to sequence, assemble, and analyze the function and structure of genomes (the complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism).

#####Genomics in America - May 13, 2016
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in collaboration with Federal agencies and private-sector stakeholders, is announcing a new National Microbiome Initiative (NMI) to foster the integrated study of microbiomes across different ecosystems

Human Genome Project
The Human Genome Project, which was led at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the National Human Genome Research Institute, produced a very high-quality version of the human genome sequence that is freely available in public databases. That international project was successfully completed in April 2003, under budget and more than two years ahead of schedule.
